# Bulk Logistics

---

Welcome to the **Bulk Logistics** repository! We specialize in the **business-to-business (B2B) transport of goods**. If your delivery involves a direct consumer, you're in the wrong place â€“ we focus solely on company-to-company logistics.

The entity that initiates a delivery order is responsible for payment. In short, **if you tell us what to do, you'll be the one paying.**
